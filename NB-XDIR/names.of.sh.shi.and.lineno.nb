Here's a breakdown of how BASH_SOURCE works:

${BASH_SOURCE[0]}: The name of the file currently being executed or sourced.
${BASH_SOURCE[1]}: The name of the file that sourced or called ${BASH_SOURCE[0]}.
${BASH_SOURCE[2]}: The name of the file that sourced or called ${BASH_SOURCE[1]}.
...

echo "Current line: $LINENO"
